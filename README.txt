Upstream on libnet is dead.

Debian and Fedora have unmerged patches.

I have patches to ip_offset handling (used for IP checksumming) to fix memory
corruption bugs, and I have the start of Lua bindings.

I've forked from packetfactory.net and am maintaining and rereleasing libnet.

Contact Sam Roberts <vieuxtech@gmail.com> if you have bugs or patches to contribute.
