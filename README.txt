Upstream on libnet was dead.

Debian and Fedora had unmerged patches.

I had patches to ip_offset handling (used for IP checksumming) to fix memory
corruption bugs, and I had the start of Lua bindings.

I forked from packetfactory.net and am maintaining and rereleasing libnet.

Contact Sam Roberts <vieuxtech@gmail.com> if you have bugs or patches to contribute.
